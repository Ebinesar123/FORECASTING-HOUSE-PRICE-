1. Sample of the Data:

Bedrooms  Bathrooms  Floors   Price
0         3        2.0       1  250000
1         4        3.0       2  375000
2         2        1.0       1  180000
3         3        2.0       1  260000
4         5        4.0       2  490000

> This table shows the first few rows from our dataset. Each row represents a house with its features and selling price.

2. Summary of Features:

Average Bedrooms: 3.2
Average Bathrooms: 2.1
Average Floors: 1.3

> On average, the houses have around 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and 1–2 floors.




---

3. Model Accuracy:

R-squared Score: 0.76

> This means the model explains 76% of the variation in house prices — a good level of prediction using only basic features.




---

4. Predicted vs Actual Prices:

Actual Prices:    [260000, 375000, 180000, 490000, 250000]
Predicted Prices: [255000, 362000, 190000, 475000, 240000]

> The predicted prices are fairly close to the actual ones, showing the model is working well.




---

5. Residuals (Error = Actual - Predicted):

Residuals: [+5000, +13000, -10000, +15000, +10000]

> These values show how far off each prediction was. Smaller errors mean better predictions.
